    "abstract": "The effect of WFH (working from home) on the quality of life of U.S. workers is not well understood. We analyze the association between WFH and overall emotional well-being during major daily activities. Using data from the 2021 Well-Being Module of the American Time Use Survey, we conduct a principal component analysis to construct a measure of overall emotional well-being and jointly estimate the association between WFH and overall emotional well-being scores in a seemingly unrelated regression framework. Our results show that compared to workers who worked outside the home, those who WFH had higher emotional well-being scores while working and eating away from home. However, no statistically significant differences were found for home-based daily activities such as relaxing, leisure, food preparation, and eating at home. These findings inform how WFH may shape the quality of a life day. ",

    "abstract": "The emergence and spread of the novel coronavirus in the U.S. were quickly followed by a widespread expansion in remote work eligibility, which, in turn, led to necessary alignments between pre-existing household management schedules and new home-based work schedules for many of those who worked from home (WFH) during the COVID-19 pandemic. We use 24-hour time diary data from the 2010\u20132020 American Time Use Survey to examine how major daily time allocations of those who WFH changed during the pandemic compared with those who worked away from home (WAFH). Before the pandemic, we find that those who WFH spent significantly less time working, commuting to work, grooming, and eating away from home, but significantly more time sleeping, socializing, relaxing, doing housework, caring for children, shopping, preparing food, and eating at home. During the pandemic, we find generally small and statistically insignificant changes in the time allocations of those who WAFH, but several large and significant changes in uses of time for those who WFH. A noteworthy intra-pandemic increase was in time devoted to labor market work by those who WFH, which almost halved the pre-pandemic WAFH-WFH difference. Results also show large and significant reductions in time devoted to other activities during the pandemic, including work-related travel, socializing, doing housework, shopping, shopping-related travel, and eating away from home. The intra-pandemic redistribution of time by those who WFH may have health and quality-of-life implications that should be assessed as the pandemic subsides and WFH becomes a more common feature of post-pandemic life.",

    "abstract": "Background: The duration and frequency of eating occasions has been identified as a factor contributing to poor dietary quality among U.S. adults. The objective of this study is to examine whether grazing, defined as eating more than three times a day, affects total daily caloric intake and dietary quality measured by the 2015 Healthy Eating Index (HEI-2015). Methods: We used a multivariate individual fixed-effects model to compare the caloric intake and dietary quality of individuals who grazed on 1\u2009day but not another. This allowed us to control for differences in individual food intake and diet quality preferences among study participants. We use the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), 2007-2018, and include data for adults aged 18\u2009years or older who reported 2\u2009days of dietary intake and were not pregnant or lactating (\ud835\ude2f\u2009=\u200927,775). Results: Grazing increased total daily caloric intake by 205\u2009cal and increased the daily HEI score by 0.59 points. Grazing increased HEI component scores for total fruit, whole fruit, and refined grains, and decreased HEI component scores for saturated fats. Morning grazing increased total daily caloric intake by 159\u2009cal and increased the daily HEI score by 0.87 points \u2014 primarily by increasing component scores for total fruit, whole fruit, whole grains, total dairy, seafood and plant proteins, and sodium. Evening grazing increased daily caloric intake by 76\u2009cal and decreased the daily HEI score by 0.41 points \u2014 primarily by decreasing the component scores for total fruit, whole grains, fatty acids, and saturated fats. Evening grazing increased HEI component scores for sodium and refined grains. Conclusions: Grazing increases daily caloric intake and can decrease dietary quality (particularly when grazing in the evening). ",

This article estimates the historical relationship between food expenditures and employment at the county level. Using these estimates, we simulate the impact of the loss of employment on food sales and find that, on average, employment loss increased food\u2010at\u2010home (FAH) sales by 1.3% and decreased food\u2010away\u2010from\u2010home (FAFH) sales by 0.5% in 2020. We argue differences to the actual 4.8% increase in FAH sales and 19.5% decrease in FAFH sales in 2020 likely stem from the more drastic COVID\u201019 pandemic\u2010related restrictions and behavioral changes.

In this paper, we examine the relationship between measured (BMI, using self-reported height and weight) and perceived weight status with the number of calories ordered in a controlled online food choice exercise. A total of 1044 participants completed an online food choice exercise in which they selected ingredients for a sandwich from five categories: meat\/protein, cheese, spread\/dressing, bread, and vegetables. We examine the number of calories ordered by participants and use linear regression to study the relationship of BMI category relative to self-reported perceived weight status with calories ordered. As a comparison to previous literature, we also examine the relationship between relative weight status and self-reported dieting behavior using logistic regression. We find that participants perceiving themselves to have a higher BMI than their BMI calculated using height and weight ordered significantly fewer calories and were more likely to report dieting than participants who perceived themselves to have a lower BMI than their calculated BMI. The relationship between perceived weight status and measured weight status explains behavior in a food choice task. Understanding how people perceive their weight may help design effective health messages. ",

    "abstract": "Telecommuting has been on the rise in the U.S. and working from home may affect how workers allocate their time over the course of a day. In this paper, using a\r\nseemingly unrelated regression (SUR) framework, we examine differences in time spent in major activities between individuals who worked from home and away from\r\nhome. We use data on prime working-age adults (age 25\u201354 years old) who participated in the 2017\u201318 Leave and Job Flexibilities Module of the American Time Use Survey. Results show that prime working-age American adults who worked from home during their diary day spent less time working and on personal care, but more time on leisure, sleeping, and on food production and consumption than those who worked away from home. For instance, among individuals with a spouse or partner present, those who worked from home spent 25 more minutes engaged in food production and 48 more minutes eating and drinking at home than did individuals who worked away from home, which are large relative to the sample averages of 33 and 31 min, respectively. These results show that there is important variation in the daily time allocation of workers in their prime working years and suggest in particular that working from home may allow for substantially more time to produce food and consume food at home, which may provide teleworkers with health benefits since home-produced meals tend to be lower in calories and higher in nutrients than meals prepared away from home.",

Each participant was randomly assigned to one of four calorie information conditions: 1) a condition in which no information about calories was provided, 2) a condition in which calorie information was provided for each ingredient, 3) a condition in which calorie information was presented relative to the highest calorie item, and 4) a condition in which calorie information was presented relative to the lowest calorie item. Participants in the high- and low-calorie reference conditions ordered between 32 and 36 fewer calories per sandwich than participants in the no-calorie information control condition (p \u2264 0.04). Calories ordered by participants in the per-item calorie condition were not significantly different than the control.

In this paper, we hypothesize that the use of cash may nudge shoppers to buy more healthful food items. We empirically evaluate whether the payment method affects the nutritional quality of food purchases. We also test whether the effect of payment type differs between food-at-home and food-away-from-home events. Specifically, we test whether shoppers purchase a higher share of nutritious food items when they pay with cash compared to when they use credit and debit cards. We use the National Household Food Acquisition and Purchase Survey (FoodAPS) data that tracks individual\u2019s food purchases over one week. Using the Guiding Stars Program (GSP) algorithm to measure the nutritional quality of food items, we calculate the share of healthy items purchased at each event. We find that shoppers using cash purchase a higher share of healthy items than when they use credit or debit cards, and this nudging effect is primarily driven by food-away-from-home purchases.",

    "abstract": "Objective: To examine whether skipping breakfast or lunch increased the next meal\u2019s energy content and changed total daily energy content and the quality of food intake measured by the 2010 Healthy Eating Index (HEI-2010). Design: Means were compared across intake days and meal patterns. Multivariate individual fixed-effects model was used to account for individual food intake and diet quality preferences. Setting: National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, 2007\u20132016. Participants: Adults aged 18 years or older who reported 2 d (24-h periods) of dietary intake and were not pregnant or lactating (\ud835\ude2f 23 488). Results: Adults consumed 193 more kJ at lunch after skipping breakfast and 783 more kJ at dinner after skipping breakfast and lunch. Skipping at least one meal reduced total daily intake between 1053 (breakfast) and 1464 (dinner) kJ and reduced the daily HEI score. Skipping breakfast or skipping lunch reduced the HEI component scores for fruit, whole grains, dairy and empty energy; skipping lunch reduced the component scores for fruit, vegetables, whole grain, dairy, seafood and plant protein, and empty energy. Skipping dinner reduced component scores for vegetables, greens and beans, dairy, protein food, seafood and plant proteins, and empty energy. Skipping one or more meals increased component scores for total vegetables (breakfast), whole grains (dinner), Na (lunch or dinner) and refined grains (breakfast, lunch or dinner). Conclusions: Skipping meals (particularly dinner) reduces daily energy intake, but the reduction in daily diet quality (particularly when skipping breakfast) may impact health negatively over time.

    "abstract": "In recent years, there has been an increase in the adventive establishment and spread of parasitoid wasps outside of their native range. However, lack of taxonomic tools can hinder the efficient screening of field-collected samples to document the establishment and range expansion of parasitoids on continent-wide geographic scales. Here we report that Leptopilina japonica (Hymenoptera, Figitidae), a parasitoid of the globally invasive fruit pest Drosophila suzukii (Diptera, Drosophilidae), is now widespread in much of North America despite not having been intentionally introduced. Surveys in 2022 using a variety of methods detected L. japonica in 10 of 11 surveyed USA States and one Canadian Province where it was not previously known to occur. In most surveys, L.  japonica was the most common species of D. suzukii parasitoid found. The surveys also resulted in the detection of Ganaspis cf. brasiliensis (Hymenoptera, Figitidae), the recently-released biological control agent of D. suzukii, in six USA States where it had not previously been found. These new detections are likely a result of intentional biological control introductions rather than spread of adventive populations. A species-specific multiplex PCR assay was developed as a rapid, accurate and cost-effective method to distinguish \ud835\ude13. \ud835\ude2b\ud835\ude22\ud835\ude31\ud835\ude30\ud835\ude2f\ud835\ude2a\ud835\ude24\ud835\ude22, G. cf. brasiliensis, the closely-related cosmopolitan parasitoid \ud835\ude13\ud835\ude26\ud835\ude31\ud835\ude35\ud835\ude30\ud835\ude31\ud835\ude2a\ud835\ude2d\ud835\ude2a\ud835\ude2f\ud835\ude22 \ud835\ude29\ud835\ude26\ud835\ude35\ud835\ude26\ud835\ude33\ud835\ude30\ud835\ude35\ud835\ude30\ud835\ude2e\ud835\ude22 (Hymenoptera, Figitidae) and other native parasitoid species. This dataset and the associated molecular tools will facilitate future studies of the spread and ecological impacts of these introduced parasitoids on multiple continents. ",

    "abstract": "Studies of the effect of calorie information on food choices in food-away-from-home settings have identified minor to insignificant changes in calories ordered. An element of the choice process that may play an important role in influencing the total caloric content of a meal has received little attention: how individuals track the total number of calories selected when choosing multiple items. We study the effects of automating this potentially costly cognitive process using technology. We compare the number of calories ordered in a sequential food choice task in two conditions: one in which participants have access to calorie information for all options\r\navailable and a second in which they are also exposed to automatically updating information about the number of calories they have ordered. Participants with access to calorie summation ordered significantly fewer calories than those without access to calorie summation. Participants without access to calorie summation significantly underestimated the number of calories they had ordered, while those in the calorie summation condition did not. The calorie summation seems to work in part through adjustment of sequential choices: calories ordered in the first choice category were very similar in the two conditions but diverged increasingly in later categories. Technologies that help individuals keep track of the nutritional consequences of cumulative choices may help promote healthier diets.",

    "abstract": "Providing calorie labeling is a widely used strategy to combat obesity. However, there is little evidence that the availability of calorie information at food-away-from-home establishments has an effect on food choices. Listing calorie information for each ingredient, though, may allow customers to avoid high-calorie items that add little to their enjoyment. Data from a natural experiment were used to compare total calories ordered before and after the provision of per-ingredient versus for build-your-own sandwiches, and per-sandwich for pre-defined sandwiches, at a supermarket sandwich counter. Sandwich order slips from a Lincoln, Neb. supermarket were collected from December 15, 2016 to February 4, 2018. In June 2017, calorie information was introduced. A total of 1134 build-your-own orders and 559 predefined orders were collected. Calories ordered before and after the provision of calorie information were examined for build-your-own and pre-defined sandwiches using two-sample t-tests. Orders post-calorie information were split into three periods to examine whether responses to information changed over time. Ingredients ordered were also examined before and after information was provided. Customers decrease calories ordered by 7.8% for build-your-own sandwiches when per-ingredient calorie information is introduced. There is no significant change in calories ordered for pre-defined sandwiches. Calorie reduction appears to result from substitution away from some higher calorie items, e.g., mayonnaise, towards lower calorie ingredients, like mustard. Despite low calorie content, customers did not increase the number of vegetables ordered. Finally, there is no attenuation of the effect of calorie information over time.",

To empirically examine how interpersonal comparisons affect productivity, this study utilizes a lab-in-the-field experiment that was conducted in Bolivia among 285 dairy farmers. The experiment consists of a baseline effort-elicitation and three treatments. The first treatment reveals to participants their baseline rankings; the second treatment allows participants to pay to destroy the output of others in their group; and the third treatment introduces inequity by\r\nplacing a randomly-chosen group member into a more favorable production setting. This paper reports three main findings. First, in the absence of destructive actions, low-productivity participants increase their productivity whereas high-productivity participants decrease their productivity. Second, more than half of the participants are willing to give up their earnings to destroy the output of their peers. Finally, those who were placed into a more favorable production setting have a 29% higher probability of being destroyed by somebody in their group, showing evidence of destructive actions being motivated by a sense of fairness.",

    "abstract": "Greenbug [Schizaphis graminum (Rondani)] is a serious insect pest that not only damages cereal crops, but also transmits several destructive viruses. The emergence of new greenbug biotypes in the field makes it urgent to identify novel greenbug resistance genes in wheat. CWI 76364 (PI 703397), a synthetic hexaploid wheat (SHW) line, exhibits greenbug resistance. Evaluation of an F2:3 population from cross OK 14319\u2009\u00d7\u2009CWI 76364 indicated that a dominant gene, designated Gb9, conditions greenbug resistance in CWI 76364. Selective genotyping of a subset of F2 plants with contrasting phenotypes by genotyping-by-sequencing identified 25 SNPs closely linked to Gb9 on chromosome arm 7DL. Ten of these SNPs were converted to Kompetitive allele-specific polymerase chain reaction (KASP) markers for genotyping the entire F2 population. Genetic analysis delimited Gb9 to a 0.6-Mb interval flanked by KASP markers located at 599,835,668 bp (Stars-KASP872) and 600,471,081 bp (Stars-KASP881) on 7DL. Gb9 was 0.5 cM distal to Stars-KASP872 and 0.5 cM proximal to Stars-KASP881. Allelism tests indicated that Gb9 is a new greenbug resistance gene which confers resistance to greenbug biotypes C, E, H, I, and TX1. TX1 is one of the most widely virulent biotypes and has overcome most known wheat greenbug resistance genes. The introgression of Gb9 into locally adapted wheat cultivars is of economic importance, and the KASP markers developed in this study can be used to tag Gb9 in cultivar development.",

This prey species is a critical forage for piscivorous birds, mammals, and fishes in estuarine and oceanic ecosystems. During a discovery project tailored to identify potentially emerging pathogens of this species, we obtained the full genome of a novel hepadnavirus (ApHBV) from clinically normal alewives collected from the Maurice River, Great Egg Harbor River, and Delaware River in New Jersey, USA during 2015\u20132018. This previously undescribed hepadnavirus contained a circular DNA genome of 3146 nucleotides. Phylogenetic analysis of the polymerase protein placed this virus in the clade of metahepadnaviruses (family: Hepadnaviridae; genus: Metahepadnavirus). There was no evidence of pathology in the internal organs of infected fish and virions were not observed in liver tissues by electron microscopy. We developed a Taqman-based quantitative (qPCR) assay and screened 182 individuals collected between 2015 and 2018 and detected additional qPCR positives (n = 6). An additional complete genome was obtained in 2018 and it has 99.4% genome nucleotide identity to the first virus. Single-nucleotide polymorphisms were observed between the two genomes, including 7\/9 and 12\/8 synonymous vs nonsynonymous mutations across the polymerase and surface proteins, respectively. While there was no evidence that this virus was associated with disease in this species, alewives are migratory interjurisdictional fishes of management concern. Identification of microbial agents using de novo sequencing and other advanced technologies is a critical aspect of understanding disease ecology for informed population management. ",

    "abstract": "Introduction: B. bovis is an apicomplexan parasite responsible for bovine babesiosis, a tick-borne disease with a worldwide impact. The disease remains inefficiently controlled, and few effective drugs, including imidocarb dipropionate (ID), are currently available in endemic areas. The objective of this study was to evaluate whether buparvaquone (BPQ), a drug currently used to treat cattle infected with the Babesia-related Theileria spp. parasites, could be active against Babesia parasites. Herein, we compared the effect of ID and BPQ on B. bovis growth in vitro erythrocyte culture. Methods: We compared the effect of ID and BPQ on the culture-adapted Texas T2Bo strain of B. bovis. In vitro cultured parasites were incubated with ID and BPQ at two starting parasitemia levels (PPE), 0.2% and 1%. In vitro cultured parasites were treated with ID or BPQ at concentrations ranging from 10 to 300\u00a0nM, during 4 consecutive days. Parasitemia levels were daily evaluated using microscopic examination. Data was compared using the independent Student\u2019s t-test. Results and discussion: Both ID and BPQ significantly inhibited (\ud835\ude31 \u0026amp;lt; 0.05) the growth of \ud835\ude09. \ud835\ude23\ud835\ude30\ud835\ude37\ud835\ude2a\ud835\ude34, regardless of the initial parasitemia used. At 1% parasitemia, BPQ had lower calculated inhibitory concentration 50 (IC50: 50.01) values than ID (IC50: 117.3). No parasites were found in wells with 0.2% starting parasitemia, treated previously with 50\u00a0nM of BPQ or ID, after 2\u00a0days of culture without drugs. At 1% parasitemia, no parasite survival was detected at 150\u00a0nM of BPQ or 300\u00a0nM of ID, suggesting that both drugs acted as babesiacidals. Conclusion: Overall, the data suggests that BPQ is effective against \ud835\ude09. \ud835\ude23\ud835\ude30\ud835\ude37\ud835\ude2a\ud835\ude34 and shows a residual effect that seems superior to ID, which is currently the first-line drug for treating bovine babesiosis globally.

Several studies have used \u201c-omics\u201d approaches to identify genetic elements with potential roles in AF resistance, but there is a lack of research identifying the involvement of small RNAs such as microRNAs (miRNAs) in maize-A. flavus interaction. In this study, we compared the miRNA profiles of three maize lines (resistant TZAR102, moderately resistant MI82, and susceptible Va35) at 8\u00a0h, 3 d, and 7 d after A. flavus infection to investigate possible regulatory antifungal role of miRNAs. A total of 316 miRNAs (275 known and 41 putative novel) belonging to 115 miRNA families were identified in response to the fungal infection across all three maize lines. Eighty-two unique miRNAs were significantly differentially expressed with 39 miRNAs exhibiting temporal differential regulation irrespective of the maize genotype, which targeted 544 genes (mRNAs) involved in diverse molecular functions. The two most notable biological processes involved in plant immunity, namely cellular responses to oxidative stress (GO:00345990) and reactive oxygen species (GO:0034614) were significantly enriched in the resistant line TZAR102. Coexpression network analysis identified 34 hubs of miRNA-mRNA pairs where nine hubs had a node in the module connected to their target gene with potentially important roles in resistance\/susceptible response of maize to A. flavus. The miRNA hubs in resistance modules (TZAR102 and MI82) were mostly connected to transcription factors and protein kinases. Specifically, the module of miRNA zma-miR156b-nb \u2013 squamosa promoter binding protein (SBP), zma-miR398a-3p \u2013 SKIP5, and zma-miR394a-5p \u2013 F-box protein 6 combinations in the resistance-associated modules were considered important candidates for future functional studies.

    "abstract": "Aminopyralid (2-pyridine carboxylic acid, 4-amino-3, 6-dichloro-2-pyridine carboxylic acid) is an auxin herbicide that has been used widely to control broadleaf weeds in pasture and hay fields. With no post-application withdrawal time, aminopyralid absorbed into forage material can contaminate compost feed stocks such as hay, grass bedding material, and manure. Composts derived from such feed stocks raises concerns about after-effect injuries to sensitive crops by residual aminopyralids. Biochar (BC) additive may affect the composting process and immobilizes organic pollutants. This study examined the effect of composting dairy manure\/sawdust 1:1 mixture containing 10 ppb (wet) of aminopyralid with 0%, 2%, 4%, and 10% (w\/w) BC levels on chemical and biological characteristics of compost, residual aminopyralid concentration, and intensity of plant injury to tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum L.) plants after composting in 140 L plastic rotary drum reactors for two 6-month cycles. Biochar addition decreased organic matter degradation and intensified reduction in residual aminopyralid levels in a dose-dependent manner. Composting with BC concentrated more N, P, and K, caused mild plant injuries, and increased the above ground biomass compared to the no BC incorporation. Addition of BC for composting aminopyralid-contaminated dairy manure can increase the phyto safety level of compost while enhancing the key fertilizer values. ",

    "abstract": "Reducing dietary crude protein (CP) is a well-established means to improve N use efficiency. Yet, few studies have considered if transient restrictions in dietary CP could reduce the environmental footprint of late lactation cows. We hypothesized that the effects of CP feeding pattern would be amplified at lower dietary CP. We tested CP levels below and near predicted requirements (LP, 13.8%; HP, 15.5%) fed in two patterns: where diets alternated \u00b11.8% CP every 2 days (oscillating; OF) or remained static (SF). Our study used a 2x2 factorial design with 16 mid- to late-lactation Holsteins (Mean = 128, standard deviation = 12 days in milk), divided into rumen-cannulated (n = 8) and non-cannulated subsets (n = 8). For each 28-day experimental period, we recorded feed intake and milk production and took samples of orts (once daily) and milk (twice daily) for four days. For the cannulated subset, we measured and sampled from the total mass of feces and urine production and collected plasma twice daily across four days. For the non-cannulated subset, we sampled gas emissions thrice daily for four days. For each subset, we fit linear mixed models with fixed effects for CP level, CP feeding pattern, and period and a random effect for cow. For selected body urea-N pools, we conducted time series analysis. Contrary to our hypothesis, we found no evidence that dietary CP level and CP feeding pattern interacted to influence N balance, nutrient digestibility, or gas emissions. Results showed HP maintained milk N but increased manure N, reducing N use efficiency relative to LP. For OF, urea-N in urine and plasma peaked 46-52 hours after the first higher-CP phase feeding. Nutrient digestibility and gas emissions were similar across treatments, except CO2 production was greater for OF-HP. In summary, measured variables were minimally affected by dietary CP alternating \u00b11.8% every 48 hours, even when average dietary CP was fed below predicted requirements (LP). Although our findings suggest that mid- to late-lactation cows are resilient to oscillation in dietary CP, oscillating CP neither reduced the environmental footprint by improving nutrient use efficiencies nor reduced the potential for direct and indirect greenhouse gas emissions.",

This study aims to tackle the gap for rice farmers in Bangladesh by exploring the potential value of tailored agronomic monsoon onset definitions. Summer \ud835\ude22\ud835\ude2e\ud835\ude22\ud835\ude2f rice is primarily cultivated under rainfed conditions, and farmers rely largely on monsoon rainfall and its onset for crop establishment. However, farmers\u2019 perception of the arrival of sufficient rains does not necessarily coincide with meteorological definitions of monsoon onset. Therefore, localized agronomic definitions of monsoon onset need to be developed and evaluated to advance in the targeted actionable climate forecast. We analyzed historical daily rainfall from four locations across a north-south gradient in Bangladesh and defined dynamic definitions of monsoon onset based on a set of local parameters. The agronomic onset definition was evaluated in terms of attainable yields simulated by a rice simulation model compared to results obtained using conventional meteorological onset parameters defined by the amount of rainfall received and static onset dates. Our results show that average simulated yields increase up to 7 \u2013 9% and probabilities of getting lower yields are reduced when the year-to-year varying dynamic onset is used over the two drier locations under fully rainfed conditions. It is mainly due to earlier transplanting dates, avoiding the impact of drought experienced with early monsoon demise. However, no yield increases are observed over the two wetter locations. This study shows the potential benefits of generating \u201clocalized and translated\u201d climate predictions. ",

    "abstract": "The shelf life of blueberry (Vaccinium corymbosum L.) fruits depends on changes in multiple fruit characteristics during storage, including texture, appearance of wrinkles and mold, and loss of water. These changes result in softening, decay, and change in flavor, which can negatively affect consumer acceptance. Therefore, understanding how breeders can select for new cultivars with extended shelf life is crucial. In this study, 20 mechanical texture parameters and four fruit appearance traits (fruit weight, fruit scar diameter, fruit height and wrinkle) were measured at harvest and six weeks post-storage in two very large (N\u0026gt;2,000) collections of northern and southern highbush blueberry (NHB, SHB, respectively) genotypes. The study is the first to assess shelf life at the scale resembling the number, genetic structure and diversity of populations used in blueberry breeding programs. The results highlighted that post-storage changes are positively correlated with initial texture. The low storage temperature for SHB best explained a notable lower rate of changes for all parameters. Correlation analysis indicated that three main texture components, Young Modulus (YMs), \u2018Distance to Maximum Force\u2019 (DFM) and \u2018Mean Internal Firmness\u2019 (MIF) contributed to blueberry texture. YMs and DFM likely represent textural characteristics of the external fruit structural components. Also, texture parameters correlated YMs and DFM explained most of the phenotypic variation observed between harvest and post-storage, suggesting that changes during storage largely occurs in the more external layers of the berry. Changes for parameters correlated to size were highly predictable, while most of the texture parameters had a low to moderate predictability. The contribution of fruit chemistry parameters to predict texture and appearance traits at harvest and post-storage was very limited or not significant. The rate of water loss and appearance of wrinkles was higher in small size berries, and was not affected by the size of the stem scar. Overall, selecting for high YMs, DFM, F1mm (Force at 1mm), Maximum Force (FM), and large size can contribute to select berries with better mechanical texture and appearance in post-storage.",

    "abstract": "Reniform nematode (Rotylenchulus reniformis) is a pathogen of cotton (Gossypium hirsutum) and crop rotation is commonly used for its management. One specific rotation system is a sod-based rotation, which uses two years of bahiagrass (Paspalum notatum) followed by one year each of peanut (Arachis hypogaea) and cotton, versus a conventional peanut-cotton-cotton rotation. High population densities of reniform nematode are found below plow depth in the soil profile, yet conventional chemical management is often not able to manage these deeper populations, nor is much known about other plant parasites such as ring nematode (Mesocriconema ornatum) and spiral nematode (Helicotylenchus dihystera) at these deeper depths. Our study aimed to investigate how long-term cropping history affects crop yield and the vertical spatial distribution of plant-parasitic (reniform, ring, and spiral) nematodes under different irrigation regimes. Between March 2017 and January 2019, soil samples were collected to a depth of 120 cm before planting, after harvest, and in the winter using a hydraulic probe. Nematode abundances (including enumeration of all reniform nematode life stages) were analyzed in 30 cm-sections. There were no significant effects of irrigation on nematode abundances (P\u0026gt;0.05). In each sampling date, all reniform nematode abundances decreased stepwise as soil depth increased, but spiral and ring nematodes were nearly absent below 30 cm. Sod-based rotation generally reduced reniform nematode abundances at all depths compared with conventional rotation, although differences were more pronounced in the shallower depths (0-30 and 30-60 cm). Conversely, at 0-30 cm soil depth, ring nematode abundances were generally greatest in the peanut phase of sod-based rotation. Similarly, spiral nematode abundances, at 0-30 cm soil depth, were generally significantly greater in bahiagrass phases than other phases and variously greater in first-year cotton (sod-based or conventional). Overall, sod-based rotation helped manage reniform nematodes up to 120 cm deep in the soil profile. Sod-based rotation was detrimental for managing minor plant-parasitic nematodes spiral and ring nematodes, and those nematodes were scarce below 30 cm deep in the soil profile.",

    "abstract": "In the southern United States, corn earworm,  Helicoperpa zea (Boddie), and soybean looper,  Chrysodeixis includens (Walker) are economically important crop pests. Although Bt crops initially provided effective control of target pests such as H. zea, many insect pests have developed resistance to these Bt crops. Alternative approaches are needed, including biological control agents such as entomopathogenic nematodes (EPNs). However, the effectiveness of EPNs for aboveground applications can be limited due to issues such as desiccation and ultraviolet radiation. Effective adjuvants are needed to overcome these problems. Ten strains of EPNs were tested for virulence against eggs, first to fourth instars, fifth instars, and pupae of H. zea and C. includens in the laboratory. These 10 EPN strains were  Heterorhabditis bacteriophora (HP88 and VS strains), H. floridensis (K22 strain), Hgkesha (Kesha strain), Steinernema carpocapsae (All and Cxrd strains), S. feltiae (SN strain), S. rarum (17c+e strain), and S. riobrave (355 and 7\u201312 strains). EPNs could infect eggs of H. zea or C.includens in the laboratory, but the infection was low. The mortality caused by 10 EPN strains in seven days was significantly higher for the first to fourth instars of H. zea compared to the control, as was the fifth instars of H. zea. Similarly, for the first to fourth and fifth instars of C. includens, the mortality was significantly higher compared to the controls, respectively. However, only S. riobrave (355) had significantly higher mortality than the control for the pupae of H. zea. For the pupae of C. includens, except for H. bacteriophora (HP88), S. rarum (17c+e), and H. floridensis (K22), the mortality of the other seven strains was significantly higher than the control. Subsequently, S. carpocapsae (All) and S. riobrave (7\u201312) were chosen for efficacy testing in the field with an adjuvant 0.066% Southern Ag Surfactant (SAg Surfactant). In field experiments, the SAg Surfactant  significantly increased the mortality and EPN infection for S. carpocapsae (All) on first instars of  H. zea in corn plant whorls. On soybean plants, with the SAg Surfactant, S. carpocapsae (All) was more effective than S. riobrave (7-12) on fifth instars of C. includens. This study indicates that EPNs can control H. zea and C. includens, and SAg Surfactant can enhance EPN efficacy.   ",

During diapause, the cessation of reproductive development represents another distinctive phenotypic change, underlining the need for adjusted modulation of gene expressions within the ovary. Although considerable advancements in screening gene expression profiles in diapausing and non-diapausing mosquitoes, there remains a gap in tissue-specific transcriptomic profiling that could elucidate the complicated formation of diverse diapause features in Cx. pipiens. Here, we filled this gap by utilizing RNA sequencing, providing a detailed examination of gene expression patterns in the fat body and ovary during diapause compared to non-diapause conditions. Functional annotation of upregulated genes identified associations with carbohydrate metabolism, stress tolerance, immunity, and epigenetic regulation. The validation of candidate genes using quantitative real-time PCR verified the differentially expressed genes identified in diapausing mosquitoes. Our findings contribute novel insights into potential regulators during diapause in Cx. pipiens, thereby opening possible avenues for developing innovative vector control strategies.",

However, a comprehensive, multi-isotope assessment of bat guano has not been established, hindering the proliferation of guano-based paleoenvironmental research. In this study, we comprehensively examine isotopic compositions of a 12,000-year long bat guano core from Cave Springs Cave, Alabama as well as relevant isotopic data from other sources to improve our understanding of each isotope system (\u03b4\u00b9\u00b3C, \u03b4\u00b9\u2075N, and \u03b4\u00b2H), the source-to-sink components of guano isotope pathways, and the fractionation occurring along each multi-step isotopic pathway from sources (i.e., soil, atmosphere, rainfall) to guano formation. We find the \u03b4\u00b9\u00b3C values of guano from Cave Springs Cave primarily reflect local vegetation with a large shift that coincides with the onset of the Anthropocene (after 1950 C.E.). We also determine that the \u03b4\u00b9\u2075N values of Cave Springs Cave guano were not associated with precipitation or any other climatic variable but instead reflect a change in bat diet and agricultural intensification during the past 600 years. Overall, this study adds to the existing body of bat guano research and supports bat guano as a reliable archive for paleoenvironmental reconstructions.",
