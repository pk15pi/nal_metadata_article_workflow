## Srupymarc 2024-09-30
- Created srupymarc fork sruthi repo
- Allows users to specify the output format as either "flatten" for a flattened dict (as in original sruthi implementation), or "pymarc" for pymarc records
- As interface and behavior is different from original sruthi package, we changed the package name to srupymarc to prevent conflicts
